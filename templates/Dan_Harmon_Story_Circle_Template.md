# Dan Harmon Story Circle Template

Use this 8-step loop to track your protagonist’s full arc. Focus on *need → change* more than plot mechanics. You can clone this for Over Par or any project.

---

## 1. You — Comfort Zone
- Who is the protagonist at the start?
- What is their status quo (job, environment, relationships)?
- What’s emotionally comfortable but ultimately limiting about this life?
- **Over Par notes:** 

## 2. Need — Something’s Wrong
- What is missing in their life (emotionally, morally, spiritually)?
- What wound, flaw, or lie are they living by?
- What event exposes that the current way of living can’t continue?
- **Over Par notes:** 

## 3. Go — Crossing the Threshold
- What decision/action takes them out of their comfort zone?
- How do they enter a new world, situation, or role?
- What do they *think* they’re going after (surface goal)?
- **Over Par notes:** 

## 4. Search — Road of Trials
- How do they explore this new world?
- What experiments, schemes, or strategies do they try?
- Who do they meet here (allies, rivals, mentors)?
- How does this world test their old beliefs?
- **Over Par notes:** 

## 5. Find — Get What They Wanted
- What apparent success do they achieve (or apparent defeat, if going tragic)?
- In what way do they “get” the thing they were chasing (status, love, money, validation, etc.)?
- How do they believe this solves their problem?
- **Over Par notes:** 

## 6. Take — The Price of Getting It
- What consequences slam into them because of this success/choice?
- How do relationships strain or break?
- How does the world push back harder (antagonist, institution, circumstances)?
- What truth about themselves do they *start* to see but resist?
- **Over Par notes:** 

## 7. Return — Bring It Back Home
- How do they take what they’ve learned in the “other world” back toward their core problem?
- What new plan or strategy emerges that uses both old strengths and new insight?
- How do they re-approach the central conflict differently than before?
- **Over Par notes:** 

## 8. Change — Reintegrated Self
- In the climax, what choice/action proves they are different now?
- How does this resolve (or fail to resolve) the outer conflict?
- How has their relationship to the original Need changed?
- What does their new status quo look like?
- **Over Par notes:**
